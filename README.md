Incubaid is a European incubator trying to deliver exciting infrastructure products in the market.
We work with a group of startups to deliver the most unique products (see www.incubaid.com)

The goal of this ebook is to describe a set of conventions how customer communication & project management can work based on agile methodologies. 

These ideas are opinionated but do result out of years trying to create good products and still maintain flexibility when delivering them to customers.

We invite everyone to contribute to this set of documents.
